# License
I'm sharing it with you so you can implement your own changes if you want so for personal use, but the software is **NOT** a free software, you are not allowed to redistirbute modified versions of it, neither as a free application, niether as a commercial product. If you are intending to do so please seek my explicit writing approval for doing so. However you are allowed to modify the software as you wish as long as the modified version is only ever used by yourself.


# Notes
This is my second Android project, I'm still learning many things on how to code and what is OOP, I never studied this in any other place than StackOverflow. This project has taken a significant part of my time and it is a commercial product. 
As I said I'm still learning so don't muck me too hard for obvious school boy mistakes :)
